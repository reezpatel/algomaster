About Repo

### `/question`

---

It Contains programming questions and there solution. If there is more than solution to it, there can be multiple file linked to it.

Each folder inside it has a `readme.md` that contains question, and some other statistics about the question.

> Some program in java need assertion to be on, to validate correctness of program, enable that using `-ea` arg in JVM.

### `/algorithm`

---

It contains (or will contain) some the most used algorithm in programming.
